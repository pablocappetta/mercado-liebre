## Mercado Liebre

This is a project that I'm working on for the [Digital House]'s course I'm attending. The goal is to replicate the home section of the original [Mercado Libre] website applying all the languages and frameworks that we're using.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a really early concept. There's more to come! :)
